		<Section title='About'>
			<p class='text-muted-foreground'>
				I was born and brought up in a small village near Thrissur called Kolazhy in Kerala, India.
			</p>
			<p class='text-muted-foreground'>
				My early passion for technology led me to pursue a unique course of study after the 7th
				grade. I joined Junior Technical High School, where I learned the basics of carpentry,
				mechanics, and electronics. After completing my 10th grade, my interest shifted towards
				embedded systems and programming, leading me to enroll in a Polytechnic program where I
				obtained my Computer Science Diploma. Following that, I pursued a B.Tech in Computer Science
				and Engineering, which I completed in 2007.
			</p>
			<p class='text-muted-foreground'>
				From my childhood days, I developed a keen interest to be a generalist and build businesses
				that make a difference and embarked on multiple side hustles. After graduating, I stumbled
				upon my first job offer at an Ed Tech startup called HeyMath! in Chennai as Software
				Engineer. It was there that I realised the gap between being college smart and possessing
				the actual skills required as a software developer in the business world to make production
				ready code. After gaining sufficient knowledge in the early years of my career, I started
				volunteering as the Campus Connect Chair for a couple of non-profits, educating students
				across colleges in South India. Along with my team, we organised various campus programs,
				events, workshops, and hackathons to bridge the skill gaps between the curriculum and
				real-world tech stacks. Additionally, I was part of managing team for two technology user
				groups in Chennai: the Adobe Flex User Group and the HTML User Group, where we organised
				events, sessions, hackathons, and provided training to the developer community on the latest
				technology trends.
			</p>
			<p class='text-muted-foreground'>
				In 2012, I joined Report Bee, an Education Data Analytics company, as a founding team
				member. As the Product Chief of Technology, I worked closely with the founders and CTO to
				build the tech team and develop the product from the ground up. In 2018, XSEED Education
				acquired Report Bee. Time with Report Bee allowed me to understand education landscape
				across the world and collaborate with various experts from governments and publishers such
				as Pearson and Oxford.
			</p>
			<p class='text-muted-foreground'>
				In 2019, I decided to take a break from formal work to bond with my family. During next 3
				years we visited 7 countries, relocated to US for my wifeâ€™s research and became dad of two
				amazing boys. Along with all these, I found Collabwrite a consulting agency, through which I
				explored my passion to build and solve growth problems. Collabwrite provided me with
				opportunities to work with several founders and leaders and their challenges in building
				MVPs, product launches, product growth. This allowed me to expand my expertise beyond
				programming, technology, and ed tech.

				ReportBee is an education data analytics company. We built various products for schools,
				book publishers and government providing various analytics and reporting to stakeholders.
				<br />Here I worked closely with founders and helped build a strong technology team of 15
				engineers and testers. I was responsible for the engineering department's operations,
				ensuring that projects are completed on time, within budget, and to a high standard. I also
				worked to maintain the company's technical standards and foster collaboration among
				engineering team.
				<!--	<br />
				More than the fancy title of Product Chief, most of my early days were spent on architecting,
				developing backend systems for our code products - school management, report cards, insights,
				question authoring, online test engine etc. I was actively involved in hiring and training new
				team members. During my stint, lead product and support engineering teams, code reviwes, mentoring,
				upskilling, conducted hackathons. -->

				HeyMath! is an educational technology company focused on mathematics education using
				animated and interactive visual/video lesson content.
				<!--<br />Starting as tech support staff, I provided assistance to customer support and
				content teams while also fixing bugs. My proactive approach led to automate many
				repetitive support requests using scripts and extending the functionality of the backoffice
				system. This initiative paved the way for my transition into lead development, where I
				quickly became one of the lead developers. In this role, I contributed significantly to
				lesson and content management platforms, an online test engine, and a school platform where students can access content.
				Additionally, I took on the responsibility of being the release manager for the entire
				tech products. MY experience further expanded during the later stages of my tenure, where
				I was involved in some major tech infrastructure changes, including the migration from
				baremetal to VPS, moving apps from windoes to linux environments. I was also of a team which did an innovative project for offline content distribution
				in South Africa. -->
